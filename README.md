# Fractals

Fractals plugin for Grasshopper (Available at [https://www.food4rhino.com/app/fractals](https://www.food4rhino.com/app/fractals) )

## Message from the Author

This was my first ever plugin for Grasshopper. I created it as an experiment back in mid-2018. Since then the number of downloads on Food4Rhino has grown to 1800+, while the plugin has only three major components. I have since worked on many more projects and did not care to update the plugin ever. I'm making the project open source in hopes that someone will add to it and improve it. For those looking for a quick way to make more fractal patterns, there's a nice Grasshopper plugin called [Chimpanzee](https://www.food4rhino.com/app/chimpanzee) that lets you create 71 different kinds of fractals.

## Development

ICO Folder contains Icons for the Plugin and Components.
SS Folder just contains some screenshots that demonstrate how to use the components.
Fractals Folder contains the actual Visual Basic VS2017 Project.
